; The esp32-cam-webserver project is intended to be easily compilable
; with the stock Arduino IDE.
; - Maintaining compatibility with other development environments
;   is important, but I wont accept changes to the PlatformIO build that
;   break compatibilty with the stock IDE. Eg by using non-standard
;   partition schemes or overriding Arduino defined limits, etc.
