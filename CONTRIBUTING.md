# Contributing to ESP32-CAM revisited
I love your input! and want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## I Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## I Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Give your branch a clear descriptive name and do your changes there.
3. If you've changed the HTTP APIs, update the documentation.
4. Issue a pull request against a branch *of the same name* in the main repo.
5. Clearly describe your changes and the reason for them in the pull request.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [License](./LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/easytarget/esp32-cam-webserver/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs in the main code

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1
